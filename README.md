# ACC RPM Monitor

A real-time audio feedback system for Assetto Corsa Competizione that helps you optimize gear shifts through progressive audio cues and intelligent shift point detection.

## Overview

ACC RPM Monitor reads telemetry data directly from ACC's shared memory to provide auditory shift indicators customized for each vehicle. The system can either use your custom RPM values or automatically learn the optimal shift points from your driving data.

## Features

### Audio Feedback System
- **Dynamic Audio Warning**: Adapts warning timing based on how fast your RPMs are climbing
  - Fast RPM increase (>500 RPM/sec): Warns earlier to compensate for rapid acceleration
  - Moderate increase (200-500 RPM/sec): Standard 300 RPM warning
  - Slow increase (<200 RPM/sec): Delayed warning for better precision
- **Progressive Audio Feedback**: Rising triangle wave tone that increases in pitch as you approach optimal shift RPM
- **Two-Stage Warning System**:
  - Rising tone starts at dynamic distance (200-600 RPM) below target shift point
  - Urgent beeping alert starts at 100 RPM below target
- **Gear-Based Frequency**: Each gear has unique audio pitch for better situational awareness
  - Gear 1: 500-600 Hz
  - Gear 2: 600-700 Hz
  - Gear 3+: Increases by 100 Hz per gear

### Intelligent Shift Detection
- **Automatic Vehicle Detection**: Identifies your current car from ACC and loads the right config
- **Dual Configuration Modes**:
  - **Manual Mode**: Define your own custom RPM shift points (fully editable)
  - **Auto Mode**: AI learns optimal shift points from your driving (read-only, auto-updates)
- **Real-Time Data Collection**:
  - Analyzes full-throttle acceleration runs
  - Calculates optimal upshift RPM per gear (lowest RPM achieving maximum speed)
  - Builds confidence scores based on data quantity
  - Press **F1** to toggle data collection on/off
- **Per-Vehicle Configuration**: Separate configs for each car, both manual and auto-generated
- **Per-Gear Customization**: Configure different shift points for each gear (1-8)

### Telemetry & Performance
- **Real-Time Telemetry**: Direct shared memory integration with ACC for instant feedback
- **RPM Rate Tracking**: Monitors RPM acceleration over 200ms window
- **Live Status Display**: Shows RPM rate, warning distance, and data collection progress
- **Interactive Setup**: Easy-to-use console menus for vehicle and mode selection

## How It Works

- **SharpDX.DirectInput** (4.2.0) - Potential future controller support

## Technical Details

### Shared Memory Integration

The application reads from ACC's shared memory mapped files:
- `Local\acpmf_physics` - Physics data (gear, RPM, speed, throttle)
- `Local\acpmf_graphics` - Graphics/UI data (session status)
- `Local\acpmf_static` - Static data (vehicle model, track name)

### Audio Engine

Dynamic Audio Engine with RPM rate tracking:
- 44.1 kHz sample rate, mono
- Triangle wave generation for smooth, non-fatigating audio
- 15% amplitude (0.15) for comfortable listening volume
- Real-time frequency modulation based on RPM
- 200ms RPM history window for rate calculation
- Adaptive warning distance calculation

### Optimal Shift Detection Algorithm

1. **Data Collection**: Records RPM, speed, throttle, and gear during driving
2. **Filtering**: Only uses full-throttle data (>95% throttle) for analysis
3. **Peak Detection**: Finds maximum speed achieved in each gear
4. **Optimal Point**: Identifies lowest RPM achieving â‰¥99% of max speed
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates reliability based on data quantity
6. **Auto-Update**: Refreshes configuration every 500 new data points

### Performance

- ~20 Hz telemetry update rate (50ms polling interval)
- Minimal CPU usage (~1-2% on modern processors)
- Sub-millisecond audio latency
- Automatic reconnection on ACC restart
- Real-time data analysis and config updates

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't connect to ACC
- Ensure ACC is fully loaded (not just in the launcher)
- Run the monitor as Administrator if permissions issues occur
- Verify ACC is running (not Assetto Corsa, which uses different memory)

### No audio feedback
- Check that you're in a live session (not menus, replays, or paused)
- Verify you're not in neutral or reverse
- Confirm your RPM is within warning distance of the configured threshold
- Check Windows audio output settings

### Auto mode not learning
- Ensure data collection is ON (press F1 to toggle)
- Drive full-throttle acceleration runs in each gear
- Need at least 50 data points per gear for confidence
- Check console for data point counter

### Configuration not saving
- Ensure the application has write permissions to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
- Check for file system errors
- Verify JSON syntax if manually editing configuration files

## Tips for Best Results

### Manual Mode
- Start conservative with shift points and adjust based on feel
- Use lower RPMs for better fuel efficiency
- Set higher RPMs for qualifying laps
- Test different values per track/conditions

### Auto Mode
- Do several full-throttle acceleration runs to build data
- Use on familiar tracks where you can safely go full throttle
- Let it collect 200+ points per gear for best accuracy
- Review auto-generated values and switch to manual for fine-tuning

### Dynamic Audio System
- Works best when you have consistent throttle application
- Lower gears benefit most from dynamic warning (faster RPM climb)
- Can temporarily disable collection (F1) during traffic/caution periods

## Future Enhancements

- GUI interface option
- DirectInput button mapping for quick profile switching
- Visual indicators for multi-monitor setups
- Telemetry data logging and export
- Lap time analysis and optimization
- Downshift detection and warnings
